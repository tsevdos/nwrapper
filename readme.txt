Nwrapper jQuery plugin
----------------------

Nwrapper is very similar to jQuery's core .wrap() function, but allows you to wrap n number of elements! For more information and code explanation have a look at my site's blog post "Wrap any amount of elements with jQuery" http://phrappe.com/javascript/wrap-any-amount-of-elements-with-jquery/ or have a look at the demo page http://phrappe.com/demos/nwrapper/nwrapper.html

Keep in mind that nwrapper jQuery plugin is also hosted at the official jQuery repository http://plugins.jquery.com/project/nwrapper
